# Committy Project RoadMap

## Project Overview
Committy is a binary application designed to replace the standard `git commit -m ""` command with an AI-powered solution that generates high-quality, professional commit messages automatically. The application analyzes git diffs and uses a locally-hosted LLM through Ollama and LlamaIndex to ensure privacy and zero cost.

## Project Goals
- Create a seamless command-line tool that integrates with existing git workflows
- Generate professional, descriptive commit messages that follow best practices
- Run entirely locally with no external API dependencies
- Improve git history readability and project documentation
